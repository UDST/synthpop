def calculate_constraints(

    """
    Calculate constraints on household or person classes using
    single category marginals and the observed class proportions
    in a population sample.

    Constraints are calculated via an iterative proportional fitting
    procedure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    marginals : pandas.Series
        The total count of each observed subcategory tracked.
        This should have a pandas.MultiIndex with the outer level containing
        high-level category descriptions and the inner level containing
        the individual subcategory breakdowns.
    joint_dist : pandas.Series
        The observed counts of each household or person class in some sample.
        The index will be a pandas.MultiIndex with a level for each observed
        class in the sample. The levels should be named for ease of
        introspection.
    tolerance : float, optional
        The condition for stopping the IPF procedure. If the change in
        constraints is less than or equal to this value after an iteration
        the calculations are stopped.
    max_iterations : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations to do before stopping and raising
        an exception.

    Returns
    -------
    constraints : pandas.Series
        Will have the index of `joint_dist` and contain the desired
        totals for each class.
    iterations : int
        Number of iterations performed.
